# fpVAE
fpVAE is an Adaptive Variational Autoencoder with Flow Prior for robust and interpretable clustering of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. By leveraging flow-based priors, fpVAE effectively captures complex latent structures in high-dimensional single-cell datasets, offering state-of-the-art performance in clustering and visualization.
