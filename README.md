# FlowAE: A Generative Representation Learning Framework via Autoencoder-Flow Integration for Single-Cell Clustering

FlowAE is a novel generative deep learning framework that integrates Autoencoder (AE) and Normalizing Flow (NF) for effective representation learning and clustering of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.


## ðŸš€ Features

- End-to-end generative representation learning.
- Superior clustering performance on multiple real scRNA-seq datasets.
- Visualizations with t-SNE/UMAP.
- Code modularization for easy extension and reuse.

## ðŸ§© Dependencies

This project was developed and tested with the following environment:

- **Python** >= 3.8  
- **PyTorch** >= 1.10  
- **scanpy**
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- **(Optional)**: CUDA-enabled GPU for faster training
